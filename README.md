# Emergence of Chimera States in Neuronal Models

In this project, I designed and numerically solved a dynamical system consisting of a regular network of FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) oscillators. An exotic phenomenon emerges: even though all neurons have identical parameters, after a sufficient amount of time, some neurons oscillate in phase while others disconnect from the synchronized group. As a result, a hybrid system of synchronized and desynchronized oscillators appears. I investigated the parameter regimes under which the system gives rise to a Chimera state.

Below is a snapshot of the voltage of all neurons at a given timeâ€”the dislodged part shows asynchrony.
